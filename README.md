# 🎨 Image_Linked_List: A Grayscale Image Manipulation Project 🛠️

Image_Linked_List is a sophisticated project that leverages the power of two-dimensional doubly-linked lists to store and manipulate pixels of grayscale images. This project is designed to work with images represented in the PGM (Portable Graymap) format, a text-based format specifically designed for grayscale images.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to compile and run a few Java files. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Compile the Java Files:** Start by compiling the provided Java files. These include:
    - `Node.java`: This file contains the implementation of the nodes in our doubly-linked list.
    - `Utilities.java`: This file includes various utility functions used throughout the project.
    - `Image.java`: This file represents the image as a two-dimensional doubly-linked list.
    - `ImageIterator.java`: This file provides an iterator for traversing the image.
    - `Direction.java`: This file defines the directions in which the iterator can move.

2. **Run the Example:** Once you've compiled the Java files, run the provided `P2.java` file. This file contains a small example that demonstrates how to use the classes implemented in this project.

I hope you enjoy exploring and using Image_Linked_List! Happy coding! 🚀
